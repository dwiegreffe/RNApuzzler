@brief      Secondary structure and loop free energy evaluation

This module covers the functions to evaluate the free energy of a secondary
structure given its sequence.

Each base pair in a secondary structure closes a loop, thereby directly
enclosing unpaired nucleotides, and/or further base pairs. Our implementation
distinguishes four basic types of loops:

- hairpin loops
- interior loops
- multibranch loops
- exterior loop

While the exterior loop is a special case without a closing pair, the other
loops are determined by the number of base pairs involved in the loop formation,
i.e. hairpin loops are 1-loops, since only a single base pair delimits the loop.
interior loops are 2-loops due to their enclosing, and enclosed base pair. All
loops where more than two base pairs are involved, are termed multibranch loops.

Any secondary structure can be decomposed into its loops. Each of the loops then
can be scored in terms of free energy, and the free energy of an entire secondary
structure is simply the sum of free energies of its loops.
