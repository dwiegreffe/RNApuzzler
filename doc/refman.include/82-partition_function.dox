@brief Compuate the partition function and various equilibrium properties
derived from it.


Instead of the minimum free energy structure the partition function of all possible structures
and from that the pairing probability for every possible pair can be calculated, using a dynamic
programming algorithm as described in @cite mccaskill:1990.
